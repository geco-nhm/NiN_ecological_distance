## Input data

This folder contains the data for generating ecological distance matrices. Description of each excel sheets are given in the documentation. 

- `NiN3.0_SplitVar.xlsx` is a copy of a NiN master file, used to extract LECs, categorical variables, and basic steps along LECs for each minor type. Ideally, it should be replaced with a cleaner and updated, complete source of this information from Artsdatabanken's webpages once those are up to date with NiN version 3.
- NiN3_categorical_variables.csv contains an overview of all major types and categorical variables: Whether there are deposits (soil etc. that vegetation may colonise) present, vegetation present, below or above the forest line, and presence of structuring speceis groups (SSG; trees and helophytes).
