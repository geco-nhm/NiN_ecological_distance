# Ecological distance for NiN version 2

See /documentation for a description of what ED is and how it is calculated. Input data are stored under /excel_files, and finished ED matrices are under /matrices. The /script directory holds the R code for creating some intermediate files and for calculating the final ED.

NB! Note that the ED in NiN version 2 and 3 should not be compared directly. The two versions contain different mapping units, gradients, and gradient lengths, and principles for calculation were changed between the two versions.
