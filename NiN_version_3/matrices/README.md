This folder contains excel files with ecological distance matrices and arrays of matrices for violations of criteria. Files with 1:5000 units, 1:20 000 units, major-type units and major-type group units are denoted with 5, 20, MT and MTgr, respectively. Files denoted with "ED" contains ecological distance matrices while those denoted with "criteria" contains arrays of matrices for violations of criteria.

`ED5000.csv` provides the estimated ecological distance between each mapping unit in 1:5000 scale. Read it in to R with `ED <- read.csv("../matrices/ED5000.csv", row.names = 1)` to get the mapping unit codes as row and column names. ED between two mapping units can then be extracted with e.g. `ED["V1-C-5","T4-C-5"]`.
